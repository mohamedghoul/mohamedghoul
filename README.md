## Hello there 👋🏻  
Welcome to my GitHub profile. A little self intro: I'm a software engineer who's passionate about exploring new technologies and using them to build solutions to real-world problems! I mostly work with Go to build strong, performant and scalable backend systems, but I do enjoy using other languages and technologies from time to time for a little fun. I'm also proficient enough in the frontend build visually appealing interfaces when it counts.

## What I'm working on 👨🏻‍💻  
I'm currently building a backend for an AI-based Edtech startup that will revolutionize academic advising. Exciting times ahead!
