Hello there!

My name is Mohamed and I'm a senior student at Qatar University pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. This is where I like to put all my personal projects (and sometimes sneak some university projects in here too)! I mostly like to build anything related to the web, whether it be frontend, backend or both! But sometimes I like to dabble in some other fields and explore my major a little further on my own.

Feel free to look around!
